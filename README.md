# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
End-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline for Twitter text using NLP preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning models using databricks

## What I built
- Data cleaning and text preprocessing (tokenization, normalization, stopwords, etc.)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF and/or embeddings)
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, F1, confusion matrix)
- Error analysis to understand failure cases

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLP tooling

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run training: `python src/train.py` (or your command)
3. Evaluate: `python src/evaluate.py`

## Project Context
This project was initially inspired by academic coursework. The implementation, experimentation, evaluation, and documentation were independently developed and extended beyond the original assignment scope.
